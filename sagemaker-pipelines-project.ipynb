    "Amazon SageMaker offers Machine Learning application developers and Machine Learning operations engineers the ability to orchestrate SageMaker jobs and author reproducible Machine Learning pipelines, deploy custom-build models for inference in real-time with low latency or offline inferences with Batch Transform, and track lineage of artifacts. You can institute sound operational practices in deploying and monitoring production workflows, deployment of model artifacts, and track artifact lineage through a simple interface, adhering to safety and best-practice paradigmsfor Machine Learning application development.\n",
    "\n",
    "The SageMaker Pipelines service supports a SageMaker Machine Learning Pipeline Domain Specific Language (DSL), which is a declarative Json specification. This DSL defines a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) of pipeline parameters and SageMaker job steps. The SageMaker Python Software Developer Kit (SDK) streamlines the generation of the pipeline DSL using constructs that are already familiar to engineers and scientists alike.\n",
    "\n",
    "The SageMaker Model Registry is where trained models are stored, versioned, and managed. Data Scientists and Machine Learning Engineers can compare model versions, approve models for deployment, and deploy models from different AWS accounts, all from a single Model Registry. SageMaker enables customers to follow the best practices with ML Ops and getting started right. Customers are able to standup a full ML Ops end-to-end system with a single API call."
